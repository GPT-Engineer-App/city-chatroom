# city-chatroom

make me a react app that is a chat room based app and you can chat with other users in your local city... or anywhere in the world.. any user makes a chatroom.. kinda like a hangout spot in any given city in the world and other users can join as guests or as actual profiles... users can then add friends with each other and direct message where they can share pictures and such... we wanna make sure when public or private any chat is sent.. we censor the curse words/bad words/racist words with just "****" so its a safe app. and is for everyone to use.
